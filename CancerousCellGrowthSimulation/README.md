This is a running simulation of the growth of cancer cells when it can profilerate, while the immune system is actively trying to kill off cancerous cells.

The system's automation is based on the classic work of Qi, Zheng, Du & An's paper A Cellular Automation Model of Cancerous Growth.

It is found that the simulation confirms Gompertz law where initially cancer cells grows exponentially, but later approaches an upper limit. The plot of results can be found here.
